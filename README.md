# odin-recipes
First Odin Project: Recipes.

A basic website with a main index page that links to 3 different recipes. This was made only using HTML and it's purpose is to put fundamental HTML lessons into practice.

This project demonstates the skill of using HTML foundations. This includes boilerplate (beginning set-up for each page), using elements and tags, writing text (paragraphs), relative links (recipe links), numbered (directions for recipes) and unordered (ingredients for recipes) lists, images (pictures of finished recipe), and commit messages.
